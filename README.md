# react-components
Assignment that demonstrates knowledge of React and how to create components. The layout of the live page is very basic and uninteresting as I did not pay much attention to how it looked. This assignment was fun and I'm starting to really like using React. I had a bit of trouble uploading the files correctly to GitHub but managed to do it eventually.
